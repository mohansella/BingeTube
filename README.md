# BingeTube 🎬

**BingeTube** is a Flutter app that lets you watch YouTube channels like a TV series — from **oldest to newest**, without re-watching videos you’ve already seen. It turns chaotic YouTube browsing into a **structured binge-watching experience**.

## ✨ Why BingeTube?

YouTube is great, but it lacks:

* Watching a channel from **episode 1 → latest**
* Skipping **already watched** videos
* Feeling of **completion** like finishing a season

BingeTube solves this by organizing videos into curated collections and tracking watch progress.
