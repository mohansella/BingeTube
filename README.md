# BingeTube

**BingeTube** is a Flutter application that allows you to watch YouTube channels like a TV series — from **oldest to newest**, without re-watching videos you’ve already seen. It transforms unstructured YouTube browsing into a **focused and organized binge-watching experience**.

## Why BingeTube?

While YouTube offers vast content, it lacks features such as:

- Watching a channel sequentially from the **first video to the latest**
- Automatically skipping **already watched** videos
- A clear sense of **progress and completion**, similar to finishing a season of a show

BingeTube addresses these gaps by organizing videos into curated collections and tracking viewing progress.
